Just my personal config for vim.

Not an IDE fan. No fancy stuff.Use plugins only if I use it often. Try focus on contents. I would gradually reduce the plugins I use.

Keep my mind active instead of passive to feel absolutely free from typing. Simplicity makes cosistence and focusing.


What does matters in vim:
- vim moving & motions
- snippets
- find anything
- seamless roaming
perhaps:
- version control
- LSP
	- auto completions
	- quick helper and refacting tips
- simple colorscheme
	- constant value
	- language key words
