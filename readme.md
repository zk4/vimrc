Just my personal config for vim.

Not an IDE fan. No fancy stuff. Try use plugins as less as possible. Try focus on contents. I would gradually reduce the plugins I use.

To feel free. Simplicity makes cosistence and helps focusing.

What does matters in vim:
- vim moving & motions
- snippets
- find anything
- seamless roaming
perhaps:
- version control
- LSP
	- auto completions
	- quick helper and refacting tips
- simple colorscheme
