Just my personal config for vim.

Not an IDE fan. No fancy stuff. Try use plugins as less as possible. Try focus on contents. I would gradually reduce the plugins I use.

To feel free.

What does matters in vim:
- vim moving & motions
- snippets
- find anything
- seamless roaming
perhaps:
- version control

What does not:
- fancy colorscheme
- auto completions
- LSP
